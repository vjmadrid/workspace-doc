# Installation / Configuration Poetry

**Poetry** is a command-line "popular" tool for dependency management tools that provides dependency resolution

* Combines environment control with dependency resolution, letting you manage your project, virtual environment and packages with a single tool
* Resolve dependencies
* Declare all the libraries your project depends on using a pyproject.toml file
* Manage (install/update) them for you as an alternative to pip
* Poetry will automatically update your pyproject.toml file
* Flags any dependency conflicts that arise
